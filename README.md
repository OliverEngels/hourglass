# Hourglass - Time Tracker

## Description
Hourglass is a minimalist desktop app designed to help you efficiently manage your time. As a freelancer managing multiple clients, I discovered the need for a straightforward way to manually log hours—without the overhead of complex systems or the requirement for user accounts. Hourglass stands out by allowing you to add time entries yourself, ensuring you have full control over what gets recorded. This makes it ideal for those who need simplicity and privacy. It operates offline and stores all data locally using MongoDB, so there’s no need for accounts or internet connectivity.
